# Software Requirements
Same software requirements as outlined in drawingSurfaceRetROISV1-V3. Here we assume that manual ROI folder is created, and colormaps are copied to Freesurfer folder.


# Background & Description
This document outlines how to draw regions of interest (ROIs) MT/MST in the visual cortex. For a deeper background on retinotopic organization of these regions please refer to the following. Keep in mind that some figures in these papers display ROIs on flattened surface, which appear different from the inflated surface:

- Amano, Wandell & Dumoulin 2009. Visual Field Maps, Population Receptive Field Sizes, Coverage in the Human MT+ Complex (Fig 1, 2, 9 & Supplement: TO1 is putative MT and TO2 is putative MST)
- Kolster, Peeters & Orban. 2010. The Retinotopic Organization of the Human Middle Temporal Area MT/V5 and Its Cortical Neighbors (Fig 2, 3, 11, 16 & Supplement).
- Huk, Dougherty & Heeger 2002. Retinotopy and Functional Subdivision of Human Areas MT and MST (Fig 2, 3, 4, 6).


# Tips for Drawing MT and MST
- For optimal ROI drawing, best to collect/analyze a motion localizer to identify the MT+ complex.
- MT and MST are typically adjacent and are located in the vicinity of the inferior temporal sulcus and the ascending limb of the occipitolateral sulcus.
- MT to MST usually represents the lower to upper to lower visual field going from poster to anterior direction.
- MT and MST share a foveal representation, and the fovea to periphery gradient runs along the ventral to dorsal direction.
